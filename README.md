# RESTful APIs Development with Database Operations

## Objectives

1. Develop a RESTful server using an open-source framework.
2. Integrate database connection with APIs for CRUD operations.
3. Analyze HTTP request and response of the developed RESTful APIs with a network packet sniffer.
4. Automate API and data structure format testing of the developed RESTful APIs.

## Equipment

- Personal computer running Microsoft WindowsÂ® 10 (and above) with a minimum of 8GB RAM.

## Theory

RESTful API:
REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is a set of methods in which HTTP clients can request information from the server via the HTTP protocol. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) are frequently performed on a collection of data. REST APIs use different HTTP request methods, corresponding to these actions, to retrieve and manipulate data.

## Procedures

1. Create a new Node.js project to develop a RESTful server using the Express framework.
2. Integrate the connection to Mongo Atlas into the RESTful server. Select either database available to proceed.
3. Develop four endpoints to handle the GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests for the Mongo CRUD operations, respectively.
4. Verify the RESTful APIs using a testing tool available off-the-shelf.
5. Analyze the Wireshark-captured packets of the implemented endpoint API calls.
6. Automate API call testing.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the development of RESTful APIs integrated with database operations provides a robust foundation for building scalable and efficient web applications. By leveraging open-source frameworks and tools, such as **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, **Postman**, **Wireshark** developers can streamline the development process and ensure the reliability and security of their applications. Additionally, the automation of API testing enhances the quality assurance process, facilitating the identification and resolution of potential issues early in the development lifecycle. Overall, this laboratory session has equipped participants with valuable skills and knowledge essential for modern web development practices.
